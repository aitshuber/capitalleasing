  title: Why Lease?
  description: "Common Reasons For Leasing: \n\n1.\tLower Monthly Payments: Lease payments are generally lower than loan payments when purchasing a trailer since you're only paying for the trailer’s depreciation over the lease term, not the full purchase price.\n2.\tMinimal Upfront Costs: Leases often require lower down payments or no down payment at all, reducing the initial financial outlay compared to buying.\n3.\tNewer Trailers: Leasing allows you to drive a new or nearly new trailer every few years, meaning you can take advantage of the latest technology, features, and safety innovations.\n4.\tLower Maintenance Costs: Since lease terms often align with the manufacturer’s warranty period, major repair costs are typically covered, and you only need to handle routine maintenance.\n5.\tNo Resale Hassles: At the end of the lease term, you simply return the trailer, avoiding the need to sell or trade in the trailer, which can be time-consuming and result in depreciation loss.\n6.\tOption to Purchase: Our leases offer the option to purchase the trailer at the end of the term, giving you flexibility if you decide you want to keep the trailer.\n7.\tTax Benefits: For business owners, leasing may offer tax advantages, as lease payments can often be deducted as a business expense, depending on the tax regulations in your city or state.\n8.\tFlexibility: Leasing is a good option for people who prefer changing trailers frequently or anticipate their needs changing (e.g., more or less horses, growing family).\nThese factors make leasing an attractive option for those who prefer a lower financial commitment and\\or the convenience of upgrading trailers regularly.\n"
